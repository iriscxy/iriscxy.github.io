Hi! I am an assistant professor in <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/natural-language-processing-department/">Natural Language Processing Department</a> at MBZUAI.
 I got my Ph.D degree  at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en">KAUST</a> supervised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/">Xiangliang Zhang</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/xin-gao/">Xin Gao</a>. Prior to KAUST, I got my B.S degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn//">Wuhan University</a> supervised by  Prof. <a href="http://nisplab.whu.edu.cn/">Qian Wang</a>  and my M.S degree in <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/GSAI_FACULTY/28026f7425324f61991c70d279372d13.htm">Rui Yan</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/info/1314/1713.htm">Dongyan Zhao</a>.

I have wide-ranging interests in research topics related to natural language processing and text generation. My specific focus is on enhancing the trustworthiness of generated text, which includes aspects such as robustness, faithfulness, and explainability. Additionally, I am interested in knowledge-enhanced text generation for high-stakes domain applications, particularly in the scientific, medical, and social fields.
