Hi! I am an assistant professor in <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/natural-language-processing-department/">Natural Language Processing Department</a> at MBZUAI.
 I got my Ph.D degree  at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en">KAUST</a> supervised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/">Xiangliang Zhang</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/xin-gao/">Xin Gao</a>. Prior to KAUST, I got my B.S degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn//">Wuhan University</a> supervised by  Prof. <a href="http://nisplab.whu.edu.cn/">Qian Wang</a>  and my M.S degree in <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/GSAI_FACULTY/28026f7425324f61991c70d279372d13.htm">Rui Yan</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/info/1314/1713.htm">Dongyan Zhao</a>.

My research advances human-centered natural language processing, aiming to build trustworthy, interpretable, and reliable large language models.

* **Foundational NLP**
  Studying reasoning [[ICLR]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21199), interpretability [[ACL]](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1233/), and Stability [[NeurIPS]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sWIbJWiEuA) in large models.

* **Real-World NLP Systems**
  Bridging research and large-scale deployment, such as in short-video platforms📱 [[ACL]](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1081/), E-commerce platforms💳 [[WSDM]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3616855.3635813) and embodied robotic systems🤖 [[AAAI]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16517).

* **AI for Science & Society**
  Applying NLP/AI to scientific discovery, including AI for Medicine
  [[Nature Computational Science]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-025-00789-7),
  AI for Chemistry [[Communications Chemistry]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-024-01394-x), Computational Social Science [[IJCAI]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09498) [[EMNLP]](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.1330/).
