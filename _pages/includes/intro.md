Hi! I am an assistant professor in <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/natural-language-processing-department/">Natural Language Processing Department</a> at MBZUAI.
 I got my Ph.D degree  at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en">KAUST</a> supervised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/">Xiangliang Zhang</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/xin-gao/">Xin Gao</a>. Prior to KAUST, I got my B.S degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn//">Wuhan University</a> supervised by  Prof. <a href="http://nisplab.whu.edu.cn/">Qian Wang</a>  and my M.S degree in <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/GSAI_FACULTY/28026f7425324f61991c70d279372d13.htm">Rui Yan</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/info/1314/1713.htm">Dongyan Zhao</a>.

My research focuses on *human-centered* natural language processing, aiming to make large language models both *trustworthy* and *aligned* with human understanding. I work on model safety, transparency, and reliability by interpreting jailbreak attacks, biases, multimodal risks, and improving response accuracy in high stakes domains. I also explore how models can better capture user intentions, emotions, and cultural contexts, enabling communication that reflects human values and empathy.
